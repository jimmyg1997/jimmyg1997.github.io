    description: "Nestled in the scenic hills near Cartago, the Carlos Dur√°n Sanatorium is one of Costa Rica's most intriguing and eerie attractions. Built in 1918 by Dr. Carlos Dur√°n Cart√≠n‚Äîwho briefly served as the country's president‚Äîthe sanatorium was originally a tuberculosis treatment center, chosen for its remote location and healing climate. At its peak, it housed up to 300 patients and was staffed largely by nuns from the Sisters of Charity Santa Anna. The facility later served as an orphanage and prison before closing permanently in the 1970s. Today, the decaying Gothic-modernist buildings and graffiti-lined corridors have earned a reputation as the country's most haunted site, attracting history buffs, ghost hunters, and explorers. Visitors can roam the grounds, discover chilling legends of ghostly nuns and children, and capture panoramic views of Cartago and the Iraz√∫ Volcano. Admission is about $3, with guided tours available for a deeper dive into its mysterious past.",
