From appreciating calm emerald waters, exploring epic caves, hiking peaks with jaw-dropping views, to watching the sun melt into the sea with a glass of wine in hand — this was a dream come true. Here's what was packed into this amazing day: pearl workshop, tasty lunch with vegetarian and fish options onboard, Sung Sot cave visit, speed boat ride, island hike with a chill at the beach below, and a sunset party with wine, fruit, and good vibes on deck. All of it for just €38.53!",

The bridge is a pedestrian crossing and features a bell under its arch to warn travelers of strong winds. It is a major attraction in the Epirus region, set against the dramatic backdrop of the Aoos Gorge and the mountains of the Vikos–Aoös National Park. The area is also popular for trekking and river rafting.",

Originally built in 1886 as a pressure release valve for a hydraulic plant, it became a permanent landmark in 1891 and reached its current height in 1951. The fountain is illuminated at night and can be seen from up to 10 kilometers away. Visitors can approach it via a stone pier, but should be mindful of sudden wind shifts that can cause a soaking. The Jet d'Eau is not just an engineering marvel, but also a glowing centerpiece of Geneva's harbor and skyline.",

At its peak, it housed up to 300 patients and was staffed largely by nuns from the Sisters of Charity Santa Anna. The facility later served as an orphanage and prison before closing permanently in the 1970s. Today, the decaying Gothic-modernist buildings and graffiti-lined corridors have earned a reputation as the country's most haunted site, attracting history buffs, ghost hunters, and explorers. Visitors can roam the grounds, discover chilling legends of ghostly nuns and children, and capture panoramic views of Cartago and the Irazú Volcano.
