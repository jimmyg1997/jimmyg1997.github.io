# Welcome
##### Current status: BSc & MSc undegraduate student @[NTUA](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en). Freelance project on the side

Welcome to my blog. My name is Dimitris and I’m an Aspiring Data Scientist.


Outside of Data Science, my interests are:

* **Traveling**: I have been traveling to North Europe for the past 4 years. I will post pictures of the trips in the Travel section
* **Sports** : I practice Crossfit. My ultimate goal is to participate in competitions here in Greece.
* **Reading/Learning**: I spend most of my free time trying to learn stuffs. I try to do 1 online course per month, although I don’t always manage to do so.
* **Projects & Competitions** : I always try to improve my programming & employability skills and enrich my engineering knowledge by working on Data Science Projects ([Kaggle](kaggle.com)) or participating in international programming competitions ([leetcode](leetcode.com), [codechef](codechef.com))

I have a BSc & MSc in Computer Science. I developed



I did an internship as a Data Scientist at the research centre of [Demokritos](https://www.iit.demokritos.gr/). I also write articles about AI, Finance & Biomedical Engineering on [Medium](https://medium.com/@dimitrisgeorgiou).
My technical interests are:
* Applied Machine Learning and Deep Learning
* Natural Language Processing
* Speech Processing
* Algorithms
* A bit of data engineering, since I’d like my next professional experience to be as a Machine Learning Engineering


I started this blog in November 2020 for several reasons:
* Writing helps me understand. Pictures and schemas too. I am trying to combine both in my articles.
* Data Science is moving fast. Reading about AI-related news could be a full-time job. I learn best by doing projects. So I post most of them here.
* I forget stuff, so it’s always good to have them written down in a single place.
* If this blog can help someone else, this really makes my day
